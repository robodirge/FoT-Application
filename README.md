Zoonou FoT Application

Copyright Zoonou, for internal use only


The Folder of Today (FoT) program is a tool that allows Zoonou staff to organise themselves every morning by creating a range of files and folders that they can use in their role. Primarily this will be used by members of the team that are either junior or experience testers. However this is not limited to those members and can potentially be used by higher members in the company when software additions are made. The program’s basic functionality has been completed and can be used by staff members, but various software additions are continuously being made. Some of these additions include; pulling platform information so that the user can add to their daily reports and other documents; another example is being able to automatically pull information such as project name and other such information from the BaseCamp. Many of these additions are in development and or been implemented. 

As of 09/12/2013 the tool as not been passed around the company yet due to many of the additions that have not been added or waiting for improvements to be made.
